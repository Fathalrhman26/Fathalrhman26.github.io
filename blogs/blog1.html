            <h2>My Journey with the GitHub All In Africa Program: Reflections, Ambitions, and the Essence of Open Source</h2>
            <p class="blog-date">July 29, 2024</p>
            <article>
                <img src="../assets/images/allin.png" alt="My Journey with the GitHub All In Africa Program" class="article-image">
                
                <h4>Introduction:</h4>
                <p>My advocacy for social good has always driven me. Being in tech, open source has been my way to contribute while advancing my career and skills. I've followed open source trends for years, looking for ways to contribute. When I found the GitHub All In Africa program, I knew it was the perfect opportunity.</p>
        
                <h4>Experience in the Program:</h4>
                <p>One of the key highlights was contributing to my first open source project it was a major milestone for me. The sessions were incredibly engaging and informative, filled with the enthusiasm of learning and the spirit of collaboration. <br> Despite my country's current war situation, learning Git and GitHub allowed me and my partner to work on our graduation project remotely, a true lifesaver.</p>
        
                <h4>Learning and Development:</h4>
                <p>I completed all GitHub skills courses, from creating an account to merging pull requests. Learning Git and GitHub has been a game changer, enabling me to overcome remote work challenges and leverage my skills for the greater good.</p>
        
                <h4>Personal Growth and Community:</h4>
                <p>Before joining the All In Africa program, I had a limited understanding of open source. Now, I see it as a collaborative, community-driven movement with immense social impact. The program introduced me to a supportive community and an inspiring regional manager who motivated me to progress. This experience has equipped me with the skills and confidence to pursue a software engineering career.</p>
        
                <h4>Open Source and Sustainable Development Goals:</h4>
                <p>Open source software can be central to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. My passion for open source led me to train as a <a href="https://socialimpact.github.com/tech-for-social-good/dpg-open-source-community-manager-program">GitHub DPG open source community manager</a>, where I'll work with AI-based initiatives. I aim to build an open source community in my country, engage more youth in tech, and contribute to rebuilding after the war.</p>
        
                <h4>Future Plans and Ambitions:</h4>
                <p>Post-graduation, I plan to apply my skills in the industry. I'm currently working on a startup focused on AI-driven health and nutrition solutions, which I hope to open source. Additionally, I'll be enhancing my community management skills to better lead open source initiatives addressing SDGs. I aspire to be part of the expert community dedicated to this noble cause, particularly in reinforcement learning and robotics.</p>
        
                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
                <p>Reflecting on my journey with <a href="https://allinopensource.org/access/africa/">All In Africa</a>, I'm filled with gratitude for this incredible opportunity. If you're considering exploring open source or joining a program like this, I say—go for it! The experience is life-changing, and the opportunities are endless.</p>
        
                <p>In my next post, I am willing to share abot my journey in entrepreneurship and innovation and how open source promotes creativity and innovation.</p>
